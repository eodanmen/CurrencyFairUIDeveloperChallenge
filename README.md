The Challenge

The design team at CurrencyFair has created two high fidelity mockups and handed those over to you to build the front end. It is your responsibility to build a UI that accurately realises the mockups and can then be passed to a back end developer to integrate.


Your Deliverables

1.	A HTML, CSS & JavaScript template.
2.	A brief presentation of the process you followed. This should highlight your end to end thought process, tools and techniques used and problems encountered throughout.


Things to note

●	You should not use a UI framework such as Bootstrap.
●	The UI should be functional on mobile devices.
●	Code should be commented and easy to maintain/iterate on.
●	The challenge will be judged based on three criteria:
○	The accuracy and attention to detail of the UI compared to the design provided.
○	The quality of code written and the use a best practice and modern approach.
○	The communication of the process followed.
